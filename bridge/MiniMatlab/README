Flex and Bison are required in order to compile and execute the MiniMatlab interpreter. 

These tools can be installed in Ubuntu by typing:

	"sudo apt-get install flex bison"

The MiniMatlab interpreter is compiled by typing "make", the command line
enviroment is started by typing "make run". A number of tests exists in the 
examples folder which can be executed by typing "make matrices", "make arrays"
etc. see the Makefile for more commands.

Executing a matlab file is done by typing bin/./MiniMatlab "filename", if you wish 
to time the execution type bin/./MiniMatlab "filename" "time" (with or without "'s).
